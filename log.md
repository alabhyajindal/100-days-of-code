# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 05, 2022

**Today's Progress**: 96% done with Basic JavaScript. Started working towards cloning the UI of Twitter. The design part of it - not functionality.
 
**Thoughts:** Feeling pretty good. I feel understanding recursion is going to take a couple of days.

**Link to work:** See Tweet for the image.

### Day 58: March 03, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Practiced Async/Await and Promises. Learned about call, apply and bind methods.
 
**Thoughts:** Good progress. I now understand how Asynchronous programming works in JavaScript.

**Link to work:** NA

### Day 60: March 05, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Started creating a simple calculator using JavaScript. Completed the layout today. I plan to redo the same project using React and compare the development process. Completed the ES6 section on freeCodeCamp. Learned about NPM. Debugged a NextJS application - the Airbnb Clone.
 
**Thoughts:** Feeling great.

**Link to work:** NA

### Day 61: March 06, 2022

**Today's Progress**: - Created a landing page for an online library as part of the Hackathon at Devsnest. Working on this app is extremely enjoyable! I might add some features just for fun.
 
**Thoughts:** Very proud of thef final result. Having the design of the final website while writing CSS makes everything super easy.

### Day 63: March 08, 2022

**Today's Progress**: - Browsed the organizations on GSoC 2022. Worked a little on the calculator application, slow progress there. Practiced promises while browsing APIs.
 
**Thoughts:** Could have done better. Removing the 'Link to Work' section here. Will put the link in the progress section if any going forward.

### Day 65: March 10, 2022

**Today's Progress**: - - Started React. I had earlier studied React by going through the documentation and exercises at https://beta.reactjs.org. I'm looking for a different resource this time. Something hands-on with lots of small projects. Started creating the calculator app using React. I feel like I need a refresher on React. I will be spending the next few days practicing fundamentals before picking up the calculator.
 
**Thoughts:** A little shocked. I thought I will be able to run through the calculator app because I had studied React earlier.
