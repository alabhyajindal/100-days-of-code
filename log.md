# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 05, 2022, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: 96% done with Basic JavaScript. Started working towards cloning the UI of Twitter. The design part of it - not functionality.
 
**Thoughts:** Feeling pretty good. I feel understanding recursion is going to take a couple of days.

**Link to work:** See Tweet for the image.
